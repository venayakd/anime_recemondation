           <h1>ONE PIECE</h1>
           <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized 
            in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters 
            compiled into 102 tankōbon volumes as of April 2022. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy,
            a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his 
            pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased King of the 
            Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the next King of the
            Pirates.
            The manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film produced by Production I.G,
            and an anime series produced by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in Japan in 1999. Additionally, 
            Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one OVA and thirteen television specials. Several 
            companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous 
            video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United
            Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids 
            Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004, before the license was dropped and
            subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.
            One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many awards 
            and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. Several volumes of the manga
            have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015, One Piece set 
            the Guinness World Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was 
            the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial
            print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more
            than 1 million copies sold in all of its 100 published tankōbon volumes. Furthermore, One Piece is the only manga
            whose volumes have ranked first every year in fourteen years of Oricon's Manga Sales Ranking existence.</p>

            <p>Monkey D. Luffy (/ˈluːfi/ LOO-fee) (Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ, Hepburn: Monkī Dī Rufi, [ɾɯɸiː]), also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy[n 1], is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut in chapter one as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the devil fruits the Gum Gum Fruit, originally known as the Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika.

                Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gold Roger as "King of the Pirates".
                
                He fights antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his elasticity to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story, as reflected in his "bounty", which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral; the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army;[9] and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.[10]
                
                Luffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations and several of the franchise's video games. Due to the series' international popularity, Luffy is one of the world's most recognizable manga and anime characters. In addition to the One Piece franchise, the character appears in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games. His critical reception is largely positive.</p>
